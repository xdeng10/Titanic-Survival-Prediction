# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Kaggle's Titanic machine learning algorithm.
Predict what sorts of people were more likely to survive (i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.)

Performed data visualization and basic data analysis using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Used the Scikit-Learn library to train the dataset and predict using the following models:
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Support Vector Machine

The model with the best fit is the Logistic Regression model.
